# jaime-ci-bot

A CI Bot based on Probot to aid Pull Requests on the SDK Repository

**NOTE**: This codebase is abandoned, so especially before attempting to use it, update all the packages (or directly rewrite it). I've been getting a lot of dependabot pings about this, so I gave up at some point and archived it.
